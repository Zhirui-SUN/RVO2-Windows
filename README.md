# Installing Python-RVO2 Package on Windows

## Dependencies Required

Install the following dependencies within your project environment:
   ```
   pip install cython
   pip install cmake
   pip install make
   ```
   
## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/Python-RVO2.git
   ```

2. **Create and Enter the Build Directory**
   ```
   cd Python-RVO2
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. **Run CMake**
   ```
   cmake ..
   ```

4. **Open the `.sln` File Generated by CMake**

   Open the `.sln` file generated by CMake in Windows and run it in `Release` mode to automatically generate the `RVO.lib` file.

   **Note**: I have generated the `RVO.lib` file in the root directory, maybe you can use it directly.

5. **Copy the `RVO.lib` File**

   Copy the `RVO.lib` file from `build/src/Release/RVO.lib` to the root directory where `setup.py` is located.

6. **Build and Install**
   ```
   cd Python-RVO2
   python setup.py build
   python setup.py install
   ```
